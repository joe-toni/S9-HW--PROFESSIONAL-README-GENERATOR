##  Description
This readme file was generated using the finished application for example purposes. The application will use a command line interface to prompt a user into providing the information needed to fill out a readme template. The application will then take a generated string and use it to write a markdown file named README.md with in the local directory. It will either overwrite the contents of an existing readme file or create on in none exists.
